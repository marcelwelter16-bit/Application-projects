# Application-projects
This repository contains a few projects I worked on during my studies of physics.
The projects are:
- Simulation of a fire spreading on a 2D-grid
- Classification of events in particle physics based on machine learning
- Numerical simulation of a rod-pendulum-system\
Each project is shortly described by a README. The corresponding codes are implemented in Juypter Notebooks where the processes are explained step-by-step.
