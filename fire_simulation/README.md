## Fire Simulation
In this project a 100 x 100 grid is used to describe a forest containing flammable (trees) and non-flammable (grass) cells.\
After inflaming one tree-cell the spread of the fire is analysed varying the amount of flammable trees and the way the fire is allowed to spread.
The spread of the fire in different cases is visualised in GIFs.
