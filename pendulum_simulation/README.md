## Pendulum Simulation
In this project the behavior of a rod-pendulum-system is analyzed.\
To that end, a few different initial conditions are considered. The emerging set of coupled differential equations are solved using two solvers, whose results are compared. The behavior of the system is visualized in a GIF.
