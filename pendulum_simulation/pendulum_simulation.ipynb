    "The massless rod of length $2L$ can rotate freely around the origin and is assumed to be massless. The system has two mounts (point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$) at the ends of the rod to which two pendulums are connected. The pendulums (lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$) can rotate freely around the mounts. The pendulums consist of two point masses $m_3$ and $m_4$ but are massless otherwise. The only external force on the system is gravitation and the systems movement all take place in the two-dimensional $x-y$ plane.\\\n",

    "The expectation is of course that the total energy should be conserved, i.e. constant over time.\\\n",
    "However, for the numerical solutions there are deviations from the energy conservation depending on the considered case, the solver and the time steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The case-dependence seems to be determined by how chaotic the system behaves. The more chaotic the systems evolves, the more changes the energy over time. Thus the cases 1 and 2 seem to always fullfill the expectation quite accurately (the variation remains far under 1 J for all simulations) while especially case 3 yields high changes in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At small time scales both solvers give energies that seem to oscillate around a certain value with similar amplitudes. This can be also seen considering the variations where `odeint` is only slightly more stable than `solve_ivp`. However, there are differences at longer scales if the system is very chaotic. Case 3 reflects this as the oscillations' envelope stays relatively constant for `odeint` while it appears to grow exponentially for `solve_ivp`, yielding maximal variations that are larger by factors of about $182$ and $14$ depending on the time steps. The reason is that both solvers use different numerical methods to solve the differential equations, namely Adams/BDF for `odeint` and Runge-Kutta for `solve_ivp`. Those methods accumulate numerical errors differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main influence of the time steps seems to be that larger steps lead to an increase of the oscillations' amplitudes, where the variations seem to scale linearly with the step size in most simulations (cases 1 and 2 for `solve_ivp` and all cases for `odeint`). In addition, solving case 3 with `solve_ivp` one can observe that the envelope grows more slowly for larger time steps. Leading to a decrease in the maximal variation."

    "Since the itself can only have kinetic energy one would expect its energy to be bound from below at 0 J. Due to energy conservation the pendula's energy should be bound from above at the total energy.\n",
    "For simulations with small time steps those expectations seem to be fullfilled well. The pendula's energy seems to be bounded by a course that looks similar to the envelop of the respective simulation in task 4.\n",
    "Only the solution of case 3 with `odeint` on the coarse time grid seem to violate the expectation because one cannot observe a clear upper bound for the energy of the pendula.\\\n",
    "Another observation is that the energy is translated much more between the rod and the pendula in the chaotic case. Meanwhile, in the more linear 2nd case both energies seem to remain constant. This makes sense because case 2 was constructed in a way that the rod does not move at all."
